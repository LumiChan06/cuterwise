            <p>Madhava of Sangamagrama was one of the greatest Indian mathematicians and astronomers.

He lived during the 14th–15th century CE in Kerala.

His birthplace, Sangamagrama, is identified with present-day Irinjalakuda in Kerala.

He is regarded as the founder of the Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics.

This school produced many brilliant scholars for centuries after him.

Madhava is best known for his pioneering work on infinite series.

He discovered the power series expansions for trigonometric functions.

These include sine, cosine, and arctangent.

His formulas anticipated modern calculus by nearly 300 years.

European mathematicians like Newton and Leibniz rediscovered them much later.

Madhava gave the series for π using the arctangent expansion.

His series, known today as the Madhava–Leibniz series, expressed π as an infinite sum.

He even provided correction terms to improve accuracy.

With these, he calculated π to 11 decimal places.

This was an extraordinary achievement for his time.

His work on sine and cosine series was equally remarkable.

He gave precise approximations for values of trigonometric functions.

These results were crucial for astronomical computations.

His understanding of convergence was far ahead of Europe.

He knew how to improve accuracy by adding correction factors.

Madhava also contributed to the concept of calculus.

He explored ideas of differentiation and integration in geometric and trigonometric contexts.

His series expansions essentially introduced the idea of Taylor series.

He provided geometric interpretations of these results.

This shows his deep mathematical insight.

In astronomy, Madhava applied his mathematics to planetary models.

He improved methods for predicting planetary positions.

He also worked on calculating eclipses and conjunctions.

His results combined mathematical innovation with observational accuracy.

The Kerala School continued his astronomical tradition.

Madhava trained a number of students who carried forward his legacy.

Scholars like Parameshvara, Nilakantha Somayaji, and Jyesthadeva followed his path.

They expanded his methods and wrote extensive commentaries.

His ideas spread through generations of Kerala mathematicians.

This created a continuous tradition of advanced mathematics.

His most famous results were preserved in works like Yuktibhāṣā by Jyesthadeva.

These texts explained Madhava’s infinite series in detail.

They presented rigorous proofs along with applications.

This shows that his mathematics was not accidental but systematic.

His results became the hallmark of the Kerala School.

Madhava’s contributions remained largely unknown outside India for centuries.

Only in the modern era have scholars recognized his greatness.

Historians now see him as a true pioneer of calculus.

He anticipated ideas that became central to modern analysis.

His work proves that Indian mathematics reached astonishing heights.

Today, Madhava is celebrated as the genius who linked ancient and modern mathematics.

His infinite series expansions stand as his greatest achievement.

He showed how mathematics could handle the infinite with precision.

His Kerala School kept Indian mathematics alive for centuries.

Madhava’s name endures as a symbol of creativity, rigor, and foresight.</p>
